# 3-Ais-ArmBot
This project is a beginner-friendly yet functional 3-Axis Robotic Armbot designed and built using basic electronic components such as the Arduino Uno, three SG90 servo motors, breadboard. The main goal behind this project was to understand the fundamentals of servo motor control, inverse kinematics and how 3-axis robotic systems work in real life.
